# Introduction

This is the developer guide for [Prusti](https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev/), intended to make Prusti more approachable for new *contributors*. For installation instructions and a tutorial on using Prusti, see the [user guide](https://viperproject.github.io/prusti-dev/user-guide).

> Direct links to code are provided in boxes like this. Note that we sometimes link to specific lines in the linked files, which requires that the links refer to a specific commit in Prusti's history. When reading through the code using this guide, make sure to check if the code has since changed.
